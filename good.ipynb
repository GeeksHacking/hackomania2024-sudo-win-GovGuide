Once an application has been submitted, companies may choose to proceed to purchase the equipment before the application outcome. However, companies will not be able to claim subsequently if the application is unsuccessful.\n",
    "- This pre-approved energy efficient equipment listing is not to be taken as a form of endorsement or recommendation by the participating government agencies. Companies are reminded to carry out due diligence when engaging vendors, and not to share their Corppass with the vendors to carry out submission of any grant applications or claims.\n",

GreenEats Food Service, a mid-sized catering company in Singapore specializing in providing healthy, sustainable meals for corporate events and private functions, is facing challenges in maintaining profitability due to increasing energy costs. \n",
      "\n",
      "GreenEats Food Service operates a large commercial kitchen that runs round the clock to cater to various clients' demands, relying heavily on equipment such as cooking hobs, refrigerators, and LED lighting. Their current outdated equipment consumes a significant amount of energy, resulting in high utility bills. To address this issue, GreenEats Food Service needs to upgrade its kitchen equipment to more energy-efficient alternatives, including modern cooking hobs, LED lighting, and refrigerators.\n",
      "\n",
      "The EEG is highly relevant to GreenEats Food Service as it provides financial support for SMEs to adopt pre-approved energy-efficient equipment, including cooking hobs, LED lighting, and refrigerators - the exact equipment GreenEats Food Service requires for their kitchen upgrade. By taking advantage of the EEG, GreenEats Food Service can reduce their energy consumption and operational costs, aligning with their commitment to sustainability. \n",

      "To apply for the EEG, GreenEats Food Service must meet the eligibility criteria, which includes being a business entity registered and operating in Singapore in the Food Service sector, having a minimum of 30% local shareholding, and having a group annual sales turnover not exceeding S$100 million or a group employment size not exceeding 200 employees. The application process involves accessing the list of pre-approved energy-efficient equipment, sourcing the equipment, obtaining a quotation, and submitting an application on the Business Grants Portal (BGP). \n",

      "Overall, the EEG presents a valuable opportunity for GreenEats Food Service to upgrade their kitchen equipment to more energy-efficient options, reducing their operational costs and supporting their sustainability goals. By participating in the EEG, GreenEats Food Service can enhance their competitiveness in the market while contributing to environmental conservation.\n"
