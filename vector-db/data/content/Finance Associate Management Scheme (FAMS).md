# Finance Associate Management Scheme (FAMS)
The Finance Associate Management Scheme (FAMS) is a talent development initiative supported by the Financial Sector Development Fund (FSDF). Its objective is to increase opportunities for Singapore Citizens (SCs) to be groomed through structured talent development programmes that can position them well for specialist and leadership roles in the financial services industry.
Under FAMS, FSDF will co-fund salary costs incurred by Financial Institutions (FIs) in the hiring and training of SCs under these talent development programmes.

## Funding 
### Funding Parameters
Funding will be provided for all incremental SCs hired by the FI, up to the total number of incremental hires committed for the year. Incremental SCs refer to SCs hired above the hiring baseline, which is determined by the average annual SC hired of the same programme in the preceding 5 years. Only SC hires who complete at least 90% of the programme duration will be funded. 

### Funding Levels
Programmes in the following priority areas will be funded based on $2,000 per SC per month, capped at 24 months:

Please see examples of each PA in the footnote below.

2. SC hires will be placed in roles within priority area(s) at the end of the programme.

Programmes in all other areas will be funded based on $1,000 per SC per month, capped at 24 months.

Programmes with at least 3 months of overseas job rotation will be funded an additional S$5,000 per SC per month, capped at 6 months.
